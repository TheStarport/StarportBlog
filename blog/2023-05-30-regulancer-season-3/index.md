Greetings Freelancers!
I'm happy to announce the 3rd Season of "Regulancer" powered by Starport and the Freelancer Galactic Community. 

In the 3rd Season, we will see some showcases of New Universe and BMOD (Better Modernised Combat Mod). The new special Event will be a Classic Mod Day where the Hoster will start a temporary server of an old classic Mod.

More information will follow in the next weeks. stay tuned for more!

## What is Regulancer?
  
Regulancer is an event series that takes place every last weekend of the month. in this series, mods and projects related to the topic of Freelancer can present themselves during a showcase event or can prepare a server event for a call of playing together.
