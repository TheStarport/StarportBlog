Hi all,

We are pleased to announce that we have transferred the old forum database over to NodeBB and have moved to a different hosting provider. 

The contents of the old forums have been moved over and will remain available for everyone indefinitely in an archived section of the new forum.

## What's Changed?
- The old forum ran on XOOPS and hadn't received any updates since 2009, we've moved over to NodeBB which is up to date, actively maintained, and overall just less buggy.
- Domain name has moved to the-starport.com from the-starport.net. We still retain ownership over the old domain, and have set up relevant redirects. If you notice any broken Starport links, please let us know!
- The entire contents of the starport's download archive has been made available in one central location. Like before, this requires registration to use. It will act as an archive, and any new Starport affiliated content should be located within the Starport Github Organisation.
- Any users who had never posted previously have been deleted. Unfortunately this means if you had never posted, you will need to make a new account.
- The staff of the site have changed, you can see the new staff [here](https://the-starport.com/forums/groups/administrators) and [here](https://the-starport.com/forums/groups/global-moderators).

## What's there still to do?

- The old Starport forge needs to be hosted somewhere new. We are working on this currently. Any repos that were previously private will remain so.
- The Lancersreactor archive is being transformed into a static website that will be easily searchable.
- FLServer.de and the stats need work but will continue to be hosted where they are for now. Stay tuned for updates.
- FLHook 4.1 development is continuing as planned, and the above tasks will not impede progress on it.

## Footnotes

We’d like to take this opportunity to thank W0dka, FriendlyFire and the old staff team for hosting the Starport for so long. We hope they’ll stick around the new forums and remain part of the community going forward into the future.

Please do let us know of any feedback or issues that you may have.

Thanks,
Laz, IrateRedKite and Raikkonen
