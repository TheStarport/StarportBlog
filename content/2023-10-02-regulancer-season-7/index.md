Good luck out there!

## What is Regulancer?
  
Regulancer is an event series that takes place every last weekend of the month. In this series, mods and projects related to the topic of Freelancer can present themselves during a showcase event or can prepare a server event for a call of playing together. These events are also streamed live on the platforms Youtube or Twitch so that everyone has the opportunity to be there.
