# Frontierspace Multiplayer Server Now Live!

We're pleased to announce that there is now a live Multiplayer server online for the Freelancer Frontierspace mod! Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGqXK79KsBo) to view the announcement trailer on Youtube.

## What's Frontierspace?

Frontierspace is a Freelancer mod that was in development for more than 3 years with the help and assets from many. It aims at bringing a greater level of difficulty to the player. With over 130 star systems, many new ships, factions, mission types, and weapons, the choices are endless, featuring secret bases protected by elite fighters and long range missions to destroy them, and more. Choose from a list of starter ships, locations and uniforms.

The original developers aren't around anymore, so **stratobrick** has been breathing new life into the mod and giving it the attention it deserves. 

Join the Frontierspace Discord channel to get links to Freelancer, the original Frontierspace mod, and the updated versions of Frontierspace. Stratobrick has been further balancing weapons, fixing bugs and crashes, and pulling in other talent to implement quality of life adjustments like widescreen.
