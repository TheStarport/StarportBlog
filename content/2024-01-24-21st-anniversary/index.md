# FREELANCER - 21st ANNIVERSARY

Greetings Freelancers!

Another Year has passed and Freelancer will get 21 years.
To celebrate this the TSP will organize a bigger 6-day event with different Mods and Projects as well as a true birthday celebration on the 04 of March. Some details still need to be clarified but we are going for another smaller but breathtaking anniversary event season like last year ;).

Stay tuned for upcoming updates and we hope to see you all when we once again celebrate our all-time favourite space game!
